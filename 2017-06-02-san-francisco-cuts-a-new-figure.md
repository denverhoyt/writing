San Francisco is a small jewel box of a city, a peninsula constrained to 47 square miles by water on three of its four sides. For all its exponential growth in population and economy in recent decades, filled to bursting at its seams of transportation and housing, the city's skyline has remained little changed since its punctuation by the acute point of the TransAmerica Pyramid in 1972. That structure was once derided as "an inhumane creation" by the city's top planner, its construction proceeding in the face of resistance on varied fronts, from well-heeled North Beach neighbors to professional groups of architects and planners. At some distance from the rest of the Financial District's high rises, the Pyramid was a strange, modern incongruity rising above an area uncluttered by other looming monuments and still mostly comprised of Victorian buildings no more than six stories tall. Progressive Architecture magazine predicted its impact would be "no less reprehensible than ... destroying the Grand Canyon". The hubris of 20 stories of spire that served no purpose other than to make it the tallest point on the horizon was, to some contemporaries, insulting. But soon after its completion, the opposition died down and the skyscraper was embraced even by some former critics. Cities change and come to be defined by their own iconoclasm; the eared trigonometry of the TransAmerica silhouette became a civic icon. "Brash and slightly odd- just like the city that calls it home," the Pyramid was described in a 2009 piece in the Chronicle, when a 1,000-foot tower on First and Market was still in the initial stages of a new zoning plan.

Today that 1,000-foot edifice is manifest. Although the finishing touches will not be complete until sometime in August, after adding nearly two stories per week since January 2016, the sharp stroke of the Pyramid on the city's horizon has been forever supplanted by the bulbous girth of the $1 billion Salesforce Tower, now the tallest building on the North American continent west of the Mississippi. The 1,070-foot profile is visible from nearly everywhere in the surrounding Bay, a titan dwarfing its surroundings. Until the design competition that planted the seed for these plans back in 2007, the height of downtown buildings was capped at a comparably modest 550 feet since the mid 1980's. For all its imposition it does cut a rather uninspired, blunt profile of sterile steel and glass. Its very name evokes the impersonal economic momentum displacing the character and charm of a city defined by its idiosyncracies and generations of outcasts.

It doesn't help that it stands alone in its immensity while its future counterparts are still under construction. Soon though, its domination will be mitigated by the some 20 high-rises under construction in the area. Half a block up first street, a 910-foot mixed-use tower will also outclimb the 853-foot pyramid, accompanied by a 628-foot-tall hotel. Viewed from afar, this cluster of towers will all echo the same cold steel and glass theme, though some of them are geometrically faceted at angles which at least hint towards visual dynamism. Altogether they will dramatically alter the skyline as a whole, upheaving the geographic weight of a city renowned for its topography.

Like its skyline-redefining predecessor 45 years ago, the Salesforce Tower has varied factions of detractors, some already referring to it as the city's "butt-plug." It does stand as the most ostentatious indication that the city is different than it was even a decade ago, and it's not going back. Even the Tenderloin, a beloved stalwart outpost of seediness, has gone the way of Twitter offices. The Millennium Tower inspired a collective shudder of Schadenfreude across the city when it was revealed that it had sunken 16 inches into landfill, listing at an angle towards the northwest. California's four-term senator and former mayor of San Francisco Dianne Feinstein, under whose purview those mid-1980's 550-foot height limits were imposed, has made no secret of her disdain for the seismic shift in her native city.

Is such a thing as the Salesforce Tower ever going to be regarded with affection by the citizenry of San Francisco? Is that obelisk ever going to recall the character of the city itself? Right now it can only be described as brash, or odd, in terms of its size and display of economic evolution outstripping the ethos of the city. If it is ever evocative of its character it will be a city little recognizable from the one we know now.
